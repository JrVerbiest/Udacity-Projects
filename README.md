# Udacity Projects

## [ðŸ”— Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity-Practical-Statistics-for-Data-Science)

In this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## [ðŸ”— ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_ML_Pipeline_Short_term_Rental_Prices_NYC)

Students will write a Machine Learning Pipeline to solve the following problem: a property management company is renting rooms and properties in New York for short periods on various rental platforms. They need to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. The company receives new data in bulk every week, so the model needs to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating a reusable pipeline. The students will write an end-to-end pipeline covering data fetching, validation, segregation, train and validation, test, and release. They will run it on an initial data sample, and then re-run it on a new data sample simulating a new data delivery.

## [ðŸ”— Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Machine_Learning_DevOps_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/main/Predict%20Customer%20Churn%20with%20Clean%20Code)

In this project, you will implement your learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI). This project will give you practice using your skills for testing, logging, and coding best practices from the lessons. It will also introduce you to a problem data scientists across companies face all the time: How do we identify (and later intervene with) customers who are likely to churn?

## [ðŸ”— A Dynamic Risk Assessment System](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Machine_Learning_DevOps_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/main/Dynamic%20risk%20assessment%20system)

In this project, students will make predictions about attrition risk in a fabricated dataset. Theyâ€™ll set up automated processes to ingest data and score, re-train, and re-deploy ML models that predict attrition risk. Theyâ€™ll write scripts to automatically check for new data and check for model drift. Theyâ€™ll also set up APIâ€™s that allow users to access model results, metrics, and diagnostics. After completing this project, students will have a full end-to-end, automated ML project that performs risk assessments. This project can be a useful addition to studentsâ€™ portfolios, and the concepts they apply in the project can be applied to business problems across a variety of industries.

## [ðŸ”— Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Deploying_ML_Model_Heroku_FastAPI)

In this project, students will deploy a machine learning model on Heroku. The students will use Git and DVC to track their code, data, and model while developing a simple classification model on the Census Income Data Set. After developing the model the students will finalize the model for production by checking its performance on slices and writing a model card encapsulating key knowledge about the model. Students will put together a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment framework and ensure their pipeline passes a series of unit tests before deployment. Lastly, an API will be written using FastAPI and will be tested locally. After successful deployment the API will be tested live using the requests module.

After completion, the student will have a working API that is live in production, a set of tests, model card, and full CI/CD framework. On its own, this project can be used as a portfolio piece, but also any of the constituent pieces can be applied to other projects, e.g. continuous integration, to further flesh them out.

## [ðŸ”— Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/master/Deployment%20Project%20Sentiment%20Analysis)

Using SageMaker, deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model, which is trained to recognize the sentiment of movie reviews (positive or negative).

## [ðŸ”— Plagiarism Detector](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/master/Plagiarism%20Detection)

Engineer features that can help identify cases of plagiarism in text and deploy a trained plagiarism detection model using Amazon SageMaker.

## [ðŸ”— Machine Learning Capstone Project - Urban Sound (Urbansound8k)](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/master/Capstone%20Project)

Environmental noise or noise pollution, which is defined as an unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activity [1], is a growing problem in urban area. This noise pollution can affect the quality of life and health. Recent studies [2] have shown that exposure to noise pollution may increase the health risk. Therefore, decreasing the noise in the human environment can contribute to increase both the quality of life and health.

Environmental noise monitoring systems continuously measure the sound levels to quantify the noise level. However, it can be of interest to identify the type of noise source. By combining the noise level and the type of noise in real time we can describe the acoustic environment in a more complete way. Based on the outcome, actions can be taken to reduce the noise levels in urban areas. However, finding the type of noise can be a challenging task there an audio recording contains a mix of different noise sources. Here machine learning can be a helpful tool.

A way to build a real time monitoring system is the use of a low cost, small size, low power, wireless embedded device. Today, there is some attention to perform machine learning direct on these devices, so called machine learning on the edge, where we deploy a pre-trained neural network close to the sensor. However, because a limited memory footprint and compute resources the deployment of a neural network on an embedded device can be a challenge. Because these limitations trade-off needs to be made between memory footprint, compute power and the accuracy of the neural network.

The design of a real time smart embedded monitoring system is, given the limit timeframe of this capstone project, out of the scope. The main objective of this capstone project is to take a first (small) step in the design of real time smart embedded system for environmental sound classification (ESC). In this capstone project we focus on the feature engineering and the neural network design.

The dataset used in this project is the Urbansound8k dataset.

## [ðŸ”— Find Donors for the CharityML](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Data_Scientist_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_Finding_Donors_for_CharityML)

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that provides financial support for people learning machine learning. To improve donor outreach effectiveness, an algorithm is built that best identifies potential donors. The goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield.

## [ðŸ”— Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_Data_Scientist_Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_Identify_Customer_Segments)

The data and design for this project is provided by Arvato Financial Services. Apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. Preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers to optimize customer outreach for a mail-order company.

## [ðŸ”— Create an Image Classifier](https://github.com/JrVerbiest/Udacity_AI_Programming_with_Python_Nanodegree)

In this project, an image classification application is implemented using a deep learning model on a dataset of images and the trained model is used to classify new images. First, develop code in a Jupyter notebook using PyTorch, second convert it into a python application that you will run from the command line of your system.
